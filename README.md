# Hello! üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

#### I'm Carol!
I'm a 33 year old full-stack software developer, currently studying Systems Analysis and Development. Solving a problem for me is like leveling up in a game, and I strongly believe technology can transform the world for the better. I have experience with .NET Core and I'm currently learning Go and Angular!
